### Optimal Release Months

Using data from the Numbers, we looked at the world grossing metric for the movies based on the month they were released. The following is how the data is grouped and the relavent analysis.

```python
world_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['worldwide_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
domestic_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['domestic_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
```

The data is grouped by month of the year and total revenue for each month is divided by the total number of movies releasesd for that month to give the average gross income per movie for that month. The results are shown below.
