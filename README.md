We then sorted by the highest rating directors and removed any negative profiting directors and directors with an average budget of around $200,000.00. Below is the recommended top directors with profit.

## Regaurding Optimized Release Dates

- Define the best timeline to roll out original content
  - Look at gross profit per movie by month

Using data from the Numbers, we looked at the world grossing metric for the movies based on the month they were released. The following is how the data is grouped and the relavent analysis.

```python
world_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['worldwide_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
domestic_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['domestic_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
```

The data is grouped by month of the year and total revenue for each month is divided by the total number of movies releasesd for that month to give the average gross income per movie for that month. Results are shown below:
