## Data Sources

The analysis described below was conducted using the data obtained from:
- iMBD
  - 331,703 titles
  - 73,856 ratings
  - 1,028.186 employee records
- The Numbers
  - 5,782 records
 
## Regarding Hiring Top Directors

 - Outstanding directors are an essential part of a successful movie.
 - Directors make their vision of the product come alive.
 - Create value - high ratings, awards, gross, impact on viewer.
 - Use the data to determine the highest rating Directors with an overall impressive budget to worldwide grossings.
 
### Top Directors

Using the data from iMDB, we averaged the movie ratings for each director and the movies they directed. We then sorted by the highest rating directors and removed any negative profiting directors and directors with an average budget of around $200,000.00. Below is the recommended top directors with profit.

## Regarding Hiring Top Actors

- Actors and actresses are the face of movies.
- Consistently high performing actors and actresses will return positively received movies.
- How the consumers view the actor/actress helps in creating studio recognition.
- Determine the top rated actors who are releasing movies and are trending upwards in ratings received.

### Top Actor/Actress

Using the data from iMDB, we averaged the movie ratings for each actor/actress and the movies they were in for each year and created a bar chart representing the trend of the ratings the movies they were in received. Our positively recommended actor and actress is Chris Evans and Jennifer Garner.

## Regaurding Optimized Release Dates

- Define the best timeline to roll out original content
  - Look at gross profit per movie by month

Using data from The Numbers, we looked at the world grossing metric for the movies based on the month they were released. The following is how the data is grouped and the relavent analysis.

```python
world_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['worldwide_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
domestic_gross_per_movie_by_month = tn_df.groupby('month').sum()['domestic_gross']/\
    tn_df.groupby('month').count()['movie']
```

The data is grouped by month of the year and total revenue for each month is divided by the total number of movies releasesd for that month to give the average gross income per movie for that month. Results are shown below:

![Gross Profit per Movie by Month](https://github.com/JCherryA050/phase_1_project/blob/main/images/gross_income_by_month_DARK.png)

This plot of the net prifits of films released after 1960 shows the total net profits of movies divided by the number of movies in the month that they were released. This gives an Idea of the average net profit per movie given a specific month. Judging from this comparrison, it can be concluded that the months that generally yeild the most profit for a new release are the Summer months of May, June, July and the holliday months of November and December.

## Regarding Common Popular Genres

- Define the best genres of movies to produce
  - Look at genres that are saturated
  - Look at genres with most votes

The data from the iMDB website was grouped by the genre and, after splicing genres, a function was applied to count the number of movies in each genre.

![Bar Plot Depicting Popular Genres](https://github.com/JCherryA050/phase_1_project/blob/main/images/number_of_movies_by_genre_DARK.png)

The average number of votes were gathered and sorted by genre. The average of the number of votes was taken for each genre and plotted in the table below:

![Bar Plot of the Most Voted Over Genres on iMBD](https://github.com/JCherryA050/phase_1_project/blob/main/images/number_of_genres_DARK.png)

These plots show the most made and most voted movies released after the year 1960. From these figures it can be concluded that the popular genres (Adventure, Sci-Fi, Action, Fantasy) and most made genres (Comedy, Drama) do not necessarily align. There could be a saturation in the most made movies that gives way to not one movie being singled out. It is recommended however to focus mostly on the most voted over genres as they will be in the public eye.

## In Conclusion

- Need to leave an impression in the market with great directors:
  - Adrian Molina, Lee Unkrich, Christopher Nolan, Pete Docter
- Actors:
  - Chris Evans, Jennifer Garner
- Perfectly timed releases:
  - Summer Months or Holidays: Big Productions
  - Dump Months: Quick Turnaround
- Top Genres
  - Common: Comedy/Dramas
  - Popular: Adventure, Sci-Fi, Action, Fantasy
